# Age-and-Gender-Detection
This project focuses on detecting the age and gender of individuals from images or video streams using a pre-trained Haar Cascade file. It utilizes facial recognition techniques combined with a deep learning model to predict age and gender with accuracy.
This project focuses on detecting the age and gender of individuals from images or video streams using a pre-trained Haar Cascade file. It utilizes facial recognition techniques combined with a deep learning model to predict age and gender with accuracy.

Features:
Facial Detection: Utilizes the Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time from images or video streams.
Age Prediction: Employs a deep learning model to estimate the age of the detected faces.
Gender Classification: Predicts the gender (male or female) using a trained neural network.
Real-Time Processing: The model can analyze live video streams or pre-recorded video feeds to output predictions on the fly.
Pre-trained Models: Includes pre-trained models for efficient and accurate detection without the need for extensive retraining.
Technologies:
OpenCV (for face detection using Haar Cascade)
Keras/TensorFlow (for age and gender prediction)
Python (for overall implementation)
Haar Cascade XML file (for facial recognition)
Pre-trained Deep Learning Models (for age and gender classification)
How It Works:
The Haar Cascade classifier detects faces in an image or video.
The detected face is cropped and passed to the pre-trained model.
The model predicts both the age range and the gender of the individual.
Results are displayed in real-time on the interface.
